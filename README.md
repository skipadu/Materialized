# Overview

[Starter code](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code) for the XYZ Reader project in Udacity's Android Nanodegree that we need to turn to use Material Design.

So mostly focused to meet the requirements of the rubric of this project. The starter code has lots of things to improve, but it was not the point of this project.

# Libraries
Libraries that were added to the project in addition to existing ones for the starter code:
* [Butter Knife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) to get rid of findViewById calls
* [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) to download images on main activity
